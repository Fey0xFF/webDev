// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
var firstNumber = prompt("What's the first number?");
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
var secondNumber = prompt("What's the second number?");
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert. 
var calcSum = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
alert("Sum is: " + calcSum);


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var firstNumber = prompt("What's the first number?");
var secondNumber = prompt("What's the second number?");
var calcDiv = Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber);
alert(firstNumber + " / " + secondNumber + " is: " + calcDiv);
